Stumble Score (in Python)
=========================
This app is a python version of an app developed for The Ruby Workshop during Philly Tech Week. It takes an address or zip code, 
geocodes it using the OpenStreetMaps Nominatim API, searches for bars, pubs, night clubs, and liquer stores within a 2 mile 
radius using Google's Places API and returns the results with the bar count, a score, and a category.

It uses the flask framework and is deployed on Heroku (http://falling-stone-3483.herokuapp.com/).
